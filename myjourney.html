        <p>
            Since I became a student at Thammasat University,  i have attended to Student core, Sci band and Basketball in freshy game 2024, During these 4 years, I want to gain as much experience and connection as possible from here. I plan to try working during my school break. I want to develop my skills as much as I can every year. In the next semester, I want to take elective subjects that I like. I am hesitating between studying Spanish and Western literature. I need to be sure that my decision will benefit me in the future. I am confident that Thammasat University will be able to provide me with the experience that I want.
